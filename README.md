# UI Framework By Amirhossein Fazli

## Introduction

This framework is being developed. This framework is very cool. You enjoy working with this framework. Of course, it has not been officially published yet. But it will be published soon and will be available to all of you. Join us ...

### core

At the core of this framework are two popular preprocessors, sass and less. Of course, we also use JavaScript in this framework, which is great. But we did not depend on JavaScript at all so that everyone could use this framework. The core of this framework is fully extensible, and the reason we used two preprocessors is that all developers can develop and customize this framework !!

Also, all parts of this framework are modular and you can use any part of this framework that you need !!

** This section will be completed soon ... **
